The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) acts as the runtime environment for Java programs. When you compile your Java code, it's translated into bytecode, a platform-independent intermediate language. The JVM then takes this bytecode and executes it. It does this by loading the bytecode into memory using the class loader, verifying its safety, and then interpreting or compiling it into machine-specific instructions using the execution engine.
Java programs can run on a variety of platforms thanks to the execution engine's two primary components: an interpreter that reads and runs bytecode line by line and a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler that can optimize performance by compiling frequently used bytecode into native machine code. The JVM also has the ability to manage memory during program execution, allocating space for objects in the heap and using garbage collection to reclaim memory from objects that are no longer needed.
